# Tiny Wanderer Table Top Robot
The Tiny Wanderer roves around any table top or surface with edges and uses IR LED's and IR Photo Resistors to calculate distance to prevent it from falling off the edge. Utilizing a hand built pcb to control all the parts.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was to construct the chassis of the little wanderer robot, which bears the control board and servos. The majority of it is constructed of plastic and screws, which create a box-like structure that wheels attach to. There is also one smaller ball bearing with rubber to act as a front stabilizer. This was quite difficult because many of the pieces of plastic had tolerance issues, meaning they didn't fit together, so I had to use a variety of tools at my disposal to widen holes or shrink parts, as well as the wrong screws and nuts. I had to become quite creative with how I made things work. I used a dremmel to expand gaps and make sanding quicker, as well as using it to cut things off. As well as the dremmel, I used the drill multiple times as the screws I had didn't fit. This overall created a challenge but also an opportunity for creativity and growth as I battled through the challenges and came up with innovative solutions.

# The Useless Machine

For my first project, I made the useless machine, a machine that, when you click the switch, an arm comes out and turns the switch off; it uses a PCB to link the switch, a battery pack, and a motor; and it uses a PCB to connect the switch, a battery pack, and a motor. One of the most challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that all of the soldering was accurate and flush with the PCB, since if it wasn't, the project would still function but portions would not work.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
